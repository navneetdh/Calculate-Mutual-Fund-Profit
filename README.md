Mutual Fund Profit Calculator using FastAPI

This Python repository features a Mutual Fund Profit Calculator implemented with FastAPI. The application utilizes the FastAPI framework to calculate the net profit for a mutual fund investment based on the scheme code, purchase date, redemption date, and initial investment amount provided. The code integrates with an external Mutual Fund API to fetch Net Asset Value (NAV) data, adjusting the start and end dates to the next available data if the specified dates are not present. The repository emphasizes clean code practices, leveraging object-oriented programming to encapsulate functionality into modular classes for improved maintainability, readability, and extensibility.
